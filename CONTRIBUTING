# Contributing to Implicit Bias

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

### Adding/modifying test data

For new tests for your own projects, it is probably best to fork this repo and add test data to the `src/data` directory. New tests belong in `src/data/tests.js`, and target/category values belong in `src/data/targetAndCategoryValues.js`. If you would like to propose new tests to add to the base project you're welcome to :) PRs modifying existing test data may or may not be accepted (in case others are using certain data already) - I would recommend making new versions of tests or data (with a _v2+ suffix) for those cases. 

Changes such as updating number of rounds per test or test display types (i.e. `src/constants/ImplicitBiasTestBlocks.js`) will likely not be accepted unless multiple users prefer different defaults, or are made as additional files (i.e. a new `ShortTestImplicitBiasTestBlocks.js`).

### Updating implicit bias testing and/or result logic

As of this writing, the implicit bias result logic we're using is fairly basic (not up to the level of precision that the official Harvard version uses). Logic updates/improvements are more than welcome!

### Making updates

This is a small, informal project so there are no strict guidelines for commit messages etc. at this time. One recommended format would be to include the type of change you're making (data/logic) in your message, i.e. "logic: add mild/moderate/strong bias results."

Thanks again for your interest in improving this humble project! Feel free to open a ticket if you have any questions about contributing or requested features.
